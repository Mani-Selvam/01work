1) Ratings Section – Requirement Breakdown

	C) Employee (User) Section
		1. Display Admin Ratings

        Keep existing features as they are:
        Request leave
        View status
        Cancel (if you already created)
        Do not change anything in user leave workflow.

                    View employee leave requests under their team

            Team Leader can mark:
                Approve (send to admin)
                Reject (send to admin)
                Team Leader cannot finalize the leave; only admin finalizes.
                (Your current functionality stays the same; only this section needs to be added.)
    C) Admin

                    [ Edit Status ] button
                    Admin can change to:
                        Reject
                        Pending
                        Re-Approve
                        If Admin Rejects a leave → show
                        [ Edit Status ] button
                Admin can change to:
                        Approve
                        Pending
                        Reject again
        3. Edit Option Requirements
