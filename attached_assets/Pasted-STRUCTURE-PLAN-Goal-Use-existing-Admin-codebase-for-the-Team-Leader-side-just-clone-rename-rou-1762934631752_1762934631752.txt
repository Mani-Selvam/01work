STRUCTURE PLAN
🎯 Goal

Use existing Admin codebase for the Team Leader side,
just clone, rename routes/components, and apply data & permission filters.

🏢 ADMIN SIDE (Already Exists)

Your existing Admin sections:

Dashboard
Company Profile
Company Settings
Payment History
Users
Team Leaders
Reports
Tasks
Messages
Ratings
Feedback
Leave Approval
Correction Requests
Attendance Monitor
Attendance Reports
Attendance Policy
Holiday Management


✅ All these are already completed and working.

👨‍🏫 TEAM LEADER SIDE (Clone from Admin Code)

You will clone the Admin modules that are reusable,
then make small modifications like:

restrict data scope to leader’s team only

remove company-level settings

rename navigation (team-[teamId])

allow Check-in / Check-out like user

🔁 CLONE PLAN

🔄 WORKFLOW FLOW

Admin Creates Team Leader

(name, email, password, role)

After creation → popup: assign members to that leader.

Team Leader Login

Login same as user

Redirect: /team-[teamId]/dashboard

Team Leader Access

Uses same UI as admin but with team filters

Can Check-in / Check-out like employee

Can view & control team attendance, leave, tasks

Admin Side Visibility

Admin can see:

Team Leader’s attendance

Team reports

Today’s completed tasks (leader + members)

Announcements by team or by member

Reports Split

Admin Report → all company data

Team Report → per team (same code filtered by team_id)

⚙️ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES (Summary)
Task	Action
UI Components	Copy from Admin folder → create Team folder
Routing	Replace /admin/... → /team-[teamId]/...
API Calls	Use same endpoints but with teamId filter (backend restricts access)
Auth	Same login page, redirect based on role = “team_leader”
Sidebar	Use same structure as admin, hide non-accessible sections
Attendance	Use existing employee attendance API (team leader acts like user)
Reports	Use existing admin report page, filter by teamId
Permissions	Add role: "team_leader" in your middleware / context

✅ Result

No need to rewrite modules.

Just reuse (clone) Admin components and logic,
apply team-based filters and hide restricted settings.

Team Leader becomes a “mini-admin” with personal attendance tracking.

Admin sees everything, including team leader activity and reports.
