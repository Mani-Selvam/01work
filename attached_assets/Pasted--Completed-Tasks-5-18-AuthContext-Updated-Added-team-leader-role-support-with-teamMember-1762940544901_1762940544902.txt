Architecture Highlights
Compliant Design:

TeamLeaderLayout properly uses shadcn Sidebar primitives (first layout in the app to do so)
TeamLeaderSidebar built with Sidebar, SidebarHeader, SidebarContent, SidebarFooter, SidebarMenu
Active state tracking and proper test IDs throughout
Mobile-responsive with SidebarTrigger and BottomNav
Smart Routing:

Root route now checks userRole and redirects appropriately:
super_admin → /super-admin/dashboard
company_admin → /admin/dashboard
team_leader → /team-leader/dashboard
company_member → /user/overview
No more double-redirects for team leaders
