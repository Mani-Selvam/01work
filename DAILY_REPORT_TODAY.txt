Good Evening Sir/Team,

✅ Today's Completed Work

-> Perfected WhatsApp-style messaging interface across all three role pages (Admin, Team Leader, User)
-> Optimized header height with compact padding (py-2) and smaller avatars (h-8 w-8)
-> Reduced message area spacing from py-3 sm:py-4 to py-2 sm:py-3 for ultra-compact layout
-> Implemented hidden scrollbars while maintaining smooth scroll functionality
-> Minimized input section padding and send button sizes (h-8 w-8 sm:h-9 sm:w-9)
-> Restructured padding distribution: horizontal (px-3 sm:px-4 lg:px-5) for readability, vertical minimal for space
-> Fixed flex container heights with min-h-0 to enable proper scrolling behavior
-> Added CSS utility class (.hide-scrollbar) for cross-browser scrollbar hiding (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
-> Ensured all three sections (header, messages, input) visible at once without page scroll
-> Maintained responsive design with responsive font sizes and spacing across breakpoints
-> Applied consistent shadow styling (shadow-sm) for modern, clean aesthetic

All messaging pages now feature WhatsApp-like compact mobile-first design with perfect height distribution and no scrollbar visibility.

Best regards,
Mani Selvam
